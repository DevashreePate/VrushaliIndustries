        <h2>üè≠ Our History</h2>
        <p>
            Established in the early 2000s, our electroplating business began with a clear vision ‚Äî to provide reliable and high-quality surface finishing services to industrial clients. What started as a small workshop has now grown into a fully equipped, modern facility known for precision, consistency, and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our early years, we focused on offering zinc plating and barrel line services to local manufacturers. As our reputation grew, so did our client base. By 2010, we proudly partnered with leading companies like <strong>Bajaj Auto</strong> and <strong>Kirloskar Filter</strong>, delivering large-scale plating solutions with unmatched efficiency and quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recognizing the importance of quality assurance and sustainability, we pursued and achieved key certifications including <strong>ISO 9001:2015</strong>, <strong>ISO 14001:2015</strong>, and <strong>ISO 45001:2018</strong>, ensuring we meet global standards in quality management, environmental care, and workplace safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, we have embraced innovation, integrating semi-automated Vatt and barrel lines and continually upgrading our processes to serve our clients better. Our team of experts, combined with cutting-edge technology, allows us to handle high-volume orders without compromising on precision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, with over <strong>20+ years of experience</strong>, we continue to deliver excellence in every project we undertake. Our journey is a testament to our dedication, values, and the trust our clients have placed in us ‚Äî a legacy we are proud to carry forward.
